# Open positions

## Postdoctoral Positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional postdoctoral positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [Killam](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/gradstudies/postdoctoral-fellows/postdoctoral-fellowships/killam-pdfs.html), [Canada Postdoctoral Research Awards](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/gradstudies/postdoctoral-fellows/postdoctoral-fellowships/Tri-agency-fellowship.html), or Dalhousie's [Donald Hill Fellowship](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/gradstudies/postdoctoral-fellows/postdoctoral-fellowships/donald-hill-pdf.html)**

## PhD Studentship

**Note: We currently don't have open positions for PhD students without their own funding**

## Masters Studentships

**Note: We currently don't have open positions for Masters students without their own funding**

## Research in Medicine or Residency Research Projects

If you are a medical student or resident that wishes to do a research project in health data science (or more specific infectious disease/medical microbiology computational work) please send me an [email](mailto:finlay.maguire@dal.ca) and we have a chat!

## Undergraduate Project Students

If you are interested in pursuing a summer internship or honours project, please send me an [email](mailto:finlay.maguire@dal.ca) early in the academic year so we can try and apply for funding to pay you (e.g., NSERC USRA). State why you are interested, the sort of project you would like to do, and attach your CV. If you are applying to fulfill specific program requirements (e.g., honours), note this in your email!

Current projects that would be a good fit (although if you have your own idea please get in touch):

- Infectious Disease Bioinformatics/Genomic Epidemiology: Working with clinicians, public health experts to continue development of the [Evolving Threat Detector](https://github.com/fmaguire/evoling_threat_detector). This is a tool that is designed to identify and report new evolving resistance to antibiotics. Great fit for any student interested in front-end development, microbial bioinformatics, machine learning, and/or working as part of an international consortia.

- Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: largescale evolutionary analyses
